# FineTune-FLAN-T5-Summarization
This project fine-tunes FLAN-T5 for text summarization using LoRA and BitsAndBytes quantization. It processes text from the BillSum dataset, tokenizes sequences, applies efficient memory optimization techniques, and trains a Transformer-based model for high-quality summarization.
